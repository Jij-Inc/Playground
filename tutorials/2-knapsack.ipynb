    "## What is the knapsack problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The knapsack problem is the problem of finding the optimal solution in the following situation.\n",
    "Also, it is known as one of the most famous NP-hard integer programming problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "As a concrete example of this problem, we consider the following story: \n",
    "\n",
    "> An explorer was exploring a cave. After walking in the cave for a while, he unexpectedly found some treasures. \n",
    "\n",
    "||Treasure A|Treasure B|Treasure C|Treasure D|Treasure E|Treasure F|\n",
    "|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\n",
    "|Price|$5000|$7000|$2000|$1000|$4000|$3000|\n",
    "|weight|800g|1000g|600g|400g|500g|300g|\n",
    "\n",
    "> Unfortunately, the explorer only had a small knapsack to carry these treasures. This knapsack can only hold 2 kg. The explorer wants the value of the treasures in this knapsack to be as valuable as possible. Which treasures should the explorer choose to bring back most efficiently?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The knapsack problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider generalization above problem. \n",
    "Let $\\{ 0, 1, \\dots, i, \\dots, N-1 \\}$ be the set of items to put in the knapsack.\n",
    "Lists of the cost $\\bm{v}$ and weight $\\bm{w}$ of each item $i$ allow us to represent the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bm{v} = \\{v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_i, \\dots, v_{N-1}\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bm{w} = \\{w_0, w_1, \\dots, w_i, \\dots, w_{N-1}\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we define a binary variable $x_i$ that represents the selection of the $i$th item. \n",
    "This binary is 1 if we choose $i$th item to put into the knapsack, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "Finally, we denote $W$ to be the capacity of the knapsack.  \n",
    "We want to maximize the total cost of item put into the knapsack.\n",
    "Therefore, let us express this requirement as an objective function.\n",
    "In addition, we should take into account the constraint for knapsack capacity limitation.\n",
    "Finally, the mathematical model of this problem is as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max \\quad \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} v_i x_i \\tag{1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{s.t.} \\quad \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} w_i x_i \\leq W \\tag{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\} \\quad (\\forall i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}) \\tag{3}\n",
